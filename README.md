## Module Purpose 

This module was developed for use in an Auto Repair Service business. 
It may, of course, be adapted to manage other businesses that include “after sales“ service.

It has been developed on XOOPS 2.4 and tested on XOOPS 2.5. 

The goal was to develop a Web application for managing car repairs. It has two different areas: mechanical and bodywork, and can handle several workers in each area. 

The module allows managing maintenance of the cars currently in the garage, follow up on current and completed repairs, and edit quotes and invoices.
