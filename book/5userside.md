# 5.0 The User Side

In the main menu you can choose a repair task sorted by status.
3 possible status choices:

* **In progress**: the repair is created and not yet ended or not started. Of course it’s possible that you are just waiting the acceptation of the quote. 

* **Ended**: the repair is terminated and the vehicle is given to the customer. The quote and the invoice have been printed.
 
* **Archived**: it’s necessary to store the history of the repair task so we keep the data in this area. I assume it’s a temporary solution and I’m working on this point for the next version of the module.


You can access to the repair in each state thru the main menu: 
 
In the “repair in progress” it’s possible to create a new repair task, update a repair, print a quote or issue an invoice.
If you have admin right, you can access the Admin area with a click on the key picture at the left top.
