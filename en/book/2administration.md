**2.10 	Documentation**

An integrated documentation system is available. It helps the administrator of the module by showing specific tips in each admin tabs.
You can of course update these tips by adding your own info. It can be useful when you use some tabs rarely and need a quick reminder about the functionality or if you delegate the admin of the module to a non-expert user.
